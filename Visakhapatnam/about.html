	<h1>Visakhapatnam</h1>
	<h3>Visakhapatnam, often called Vizag, stands as Andhra Pradesh's largest city and a bustling industrial hub along the Bay of Bengal. Its breathtaking beaches, like the popular Rushikonda and Ramakrishna, draw locals and tourists alike, offering serene landscapes and water sports adventures. The city's blend of modern infrastructure, maritime history displayed at INS Kursura Submarine Museum, and the picturesque Araku Valley nearby make it a multifaceted gem.</h3>
